    "P1":"<h2> Welcome! </h2> <p> My name is Sándor Csatári. As a veteran motor racer we have noticed that there is a need for 24 hour reliability races on high-quality spokes. Our company is a family enterprise that has been dealing with the manufacture of spokes for motor bicycles and cars since 1998. At the beginning we produced only parts, but after a short time there was a great demand for professional installation, so we expanded our business. Békés-Wheel Bt was founded in 2005 with my father and brother. Over the years, our family business has been manufacturing dozens of veteran car and engine types from Pannónia motorcycles to Bugatties. By the time we have done so, we strive to meet our customers' unique needs with continuous technological development. </p>",
