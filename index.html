                        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
                        <p>My name is Sándor Csatári. As a veteran motorcycle racer, we noticed the demand for
                            high-quality spokes in 24-hour endurance races. Our company is a family business that has
                            been manufacturing motorcycle and car spokes and spoke nipples since 1998. Initially, we
                            only made parts, but soon there was a large demand for professional assembly, so we expanded
                            our activities. Békés-Kerék Bt was established in 2005 with the help of my father and
                            brother. Over time, our family business has produced spokes for dozens of vintage
                            motorcycles and cars, whether it’s a Pannonia motorcycle or a Bugatti vintage car. We
                            continuously develop our technology to meet the unique needs of our customers.</p>

                        <h2>Technology</h2>
                        <p>
                            The wire coil is placed on the spoke-making machine, straightened through rollers, and cut
                            to length, during which the head is cold-forged. Cold forging strengthens the structure of
                            the spoke material.<br>
                            Next, the neck of the spoke is bent to the customer’s specifications. The thread is then
                            rolled onto the spoke. This method is advantageous because it preserves the material’s fiber
                            structure.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h2>Raw Material</h2>
                        <p>The raw material is soft carbon steel wire C-26D. Its tensile strength, depending on
                            diameter, is around 900N/mm². It arrives from the wire factory in 100kg coils, untreated,
                            and does not require further surface processing due to its excellent quality. After chemical
                            cleaning, the finished product is galvanized to protect the surface during processing.<br>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h2>Reinforced Spokes</h2>
                        <p>We are constantly developing our manufacturing technology and recently began producing
                            reinforced spokes. The advantage is that it combines two material properties. A thicker,
                            softer, more flexible material is needed at the head to withstand stress. The spoke shaft
                            only endures tension, so a thinner cross-section is sufficient (due to the process, reduced
                            cross-section increases tensile strength). These spokes have greater load capacity but lower
                            weight compared to uniform-diameter ones!<br></p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>The price of spokes ranges from 0.5 to 2.5 euros per piece, including the nipple, depending
                            on type and size.</p>

                        <p>For some models we produce regularly (Pannonia, Csepel, Simson, MZ), we already know the
                            spoke dimensions.
                            However, we mostly fulfill custom orders.<br>
                            Minimum quantity is 1 wheel, usually 36-40 spokes. There can be up to 4 different types per
                            wheel! (min. qty 4x9 pcs)
                            Since the spokes are custom-made, production time is typically 4-6 weeks plus shipping.</p>

                        <p>When placing an order, please provide the exact spoke specifications using the diagram below:
